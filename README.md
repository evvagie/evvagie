**SparkUp**
:point_right: Team-built Python/Flask application that helps users discover and track activities. It integrates the Bored API with a relational database and follows a service–repository architecture, using the database as the single source of truth. This app was created as the final project of the Code First Girls' programming course in Software Engineering, where I was sponsored by Goldman Sachs.
:point_right: My role: Implemented and tested the service layer (services.py), handling business logic, API–database orchestration, weighted sourcing, and fallback strategies.
